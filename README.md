# Mado Mail

A Windows Gmail triage app built with Rust and GPUI. The repository root is a single Rust crate; application code lives in `src/`.

## Requirements

- Stable Rust.
- Visual Studio C++ build tools with a Windows SDK.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime for the restricted HTML reader.
- Task, optional. Cargo commands work directly.

## Run and check

```text
task run           # Build and launch with Gmail
task demo          # Synthetic Inbox, no Gmail access or personal settings writes
task reader-demo   # Synthetic HTML reader
task build         # Release executable in target/release/mado-mail.exe
task test          # Model, settings, OAuth, MIME, and synthetic HTTP tests
task check-triage  # Native UI checks with synthetic mail
task clean         # Remove Rust build artifacts
task --list        # Additional focused UI checks
```

Without Task, run `cargo run --release`. Cargo fetches the required Rust dependencies.

## Gmail setup

1. Enable Gmail API in your Google Cloud project and create a Desktop app OAuth client.
2. Save the downloaded JSON at `%USERPROFILE%\.mado\mado-mail\client_secret.json`.
3. Add your account as a test user if the consent app is in Testing.
4. Run the app and choose Connect Gmail. It requests `gmail.modify` permission.

Refresh tokens use Windows Credential Manager. Settings, sender rules, and submission recovery files live in `%USERPROFILE%\.mado\mado-mail`. Removing the old project does not remove personal settings or credentials. Existing exported settings can still be imported through Rules.

Design, research, and `docs/history/` documents retain migration history, including paths and names from earlier snapshots. Matched speed and total-memory comparisons against the former Electron app have not been performed.
